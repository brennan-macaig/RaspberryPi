My Raspberry Pi Stuff
################

This is a project for storing all my Raspberry Pi stuff. This is a mixture of code I have made and some code I've downloaded.

My Raspberry Pi runs headless right now, and may in the future be used with OctoPrint to run my FolgerTech Kossel 2020 3D Printer. Who knows.

Right now, I use it as an apache server for web testing.


### What does stuff do?

`lcd_status.py` is a LCD-Status display. Basically, it displays the current local IP of the Raspberry Pi so that I can SSH to it easily. In the future, LCD-Status will let me toggle the backlight functionality of the display, as well as read other things out to me (like current core temp, usage stats, system uptime, etc. etc.) but currently that's what it does.


### Can I use this stuff?

I mean, sure. Some of it is probably project-specific though, so I would think twice before just blanket installing everything.
